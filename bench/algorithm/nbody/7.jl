# This implementation was specifically written so that for-loops have
# integer-literal ranges as their iterable. This makes the number of
# loop iterations available as a compile-time constant, so llvm can
# unroll them. To convince llvm to do so, this script should be run
# with the evironment variable:
# JULIA_LLVM_ARGS='-unroll-threshold=500'.
