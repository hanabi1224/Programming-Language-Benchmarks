# Why Build This

The idea is to build an automatic process for benchmark generation and pulishing.

### Comparable numbers

_It currently use CI to generate benchmark results to guarantee all the numbers are generated from the same environment at nearly the same time. All benchmark tests are executed in a single CI job_

### Automatic publish

_Once a change is merged into main branch, the CI job will re-generate and publish the static website_

## Main Goals

- Compare performance differences between different languages. Note that implementations might be using different optimizations, e.g. with or w/o multithreading, please do read the source code to check if it's a fair comparision or not.
- Compare performance differences between different compilers or runtimes of the same language with the same source code.
- Facilitate benchmarking on real server environments as nowadays more and more applications are deployed with docker/k8s. It's likely to get a very different result from what you get on your dev machine.
- A reference for CI setup / Dev environment setup / package management setup for different languages. Refer to [Github action](https://github.com/hanabi1224/Programming-Language-Benchmarks/blob/main/.github/workflows/bench.yml)

# [Website](https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/)

### Build

To achieve better SEO, the published site is static and prerenderd, powered by [nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/).

### Host

The website is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

### Development

```
git clone https://github.com/hanabi1224/Another-Benchmarks-Game.git

cd website
yarn
yarn generate
yarn dev
```

# Benchmarks

_All benchmarks are defined in [bench.yaml](https://github.com/hanabi1224/Another-Benchmarks-Game/blob/main/bench/bench.yaml)_

_Current benchmarks problems and their implementations are from [The Computer Language Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/) ([ Repo](https://salsa.debian.org/benchmarksgame-team/benchmarksgame/))_

# Local development

## Prerequisites

[docker](https://www.docker.com/)

[net6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)

[nodejs 14](https://nodejs.org/)

[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Build

_The 1st step is to build source code from various of lanuages_

```bash
cd bench
# To build a subset
dotnet run -p tool -- --task build --langs lisp go --problems nbody helloworld --force-rebuild
# To build all
dotnet run -p tool -- --task build
```

## Test

_The 2nd step is to test built binaries to ensure the correctness of their implementation_

```bash
cd bench
# To test a subset
dotnet run -p tool -- --task test --langs lisp go --problems nbody helloworld
# To test all
dotnet run -p tool -- --task test
```

## Bench

_The 3rd step is to generate benchmarks_

```bash
cd bench
# To bench a subset
dotnet run -p tool -- --task bench --langs lisp go --problems nbody helloworld
# To bench all
dotnet run -p tool -- --task bench
```

_For usage_

```bash
cd bench
dotnet run -p tool -- -h

BenchTool
  Main function

Usage:
  BenchTool [options]

Options:
  --config <config>              Path to benchmark config file [default: bench.yaml]
  --algorithm <algorithm>        Root path that contains all algorithm code [default: algorithm]
  --include <include>            Root path that contains all include project templates [default: include]
  --build-output <build-output>  Output folder of build step [default: build]
  --task <task>                  Benchmark task to run, valid values: build, test, bench [default: build]
  --force-pull-docker            A flag that indicates whether to force pull docker image even when it exists [default: False]
  --force-rebuild                A flag that indicates whether to force rebuild [default: False]
  --fail-fast                    A Flag that indicates whether to fail fast when error occurs [default: False]
  --build-pool                   A flag that indicates whether builds that can run in parallel [default: False]
  --verbose                      A Flag that indicates whether to print verbose infomation [default: False]
  --no-docker                    A Flag that forces disabling docker [default: False]
  --langs <langs>                Languages to incldue, e.g. --langs go csharp [default: ]
  --problems <problems>          Problems to incldue, e.g. --problems binarytrees nbody [default: ]
  --environments <environments>  OS environments to incldue, e.g. --environments linux windows [default: ]
  --version                      Show version information
  -?, -h, --help                 Show help and usage information
```

## Referesh website

_Lastly you can re-generate website with latest benchmark numbers_

```
cd website
yarn
yarn content
yarn generate
serve dist
```
